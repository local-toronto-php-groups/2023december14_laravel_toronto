Unfortunately, due to time pressures, Astrid Bailey and Katrina James are unable to do the preparation for their "Laravel Application From Scratch" presentation.

Lukasz Zagroba emailed me with a great question, and a tremendous inspiration. THANK YOU! Why not try out "Mob Programming"? Even though I have never tried it, nor Lukasz, and none of our Groups have tried it, why not go for it anyways? 

I know that the Guelph PHP User Group, run by Canada's only Laravel Partner, Vehikl, who helped get Laravel Toronto off the ground in the early days with SoapBox, uses Mob Programming, and does it from time to time at GPUG. I know this because Colin gave me a personal tour at Vehikl's offices in Waterloo and described what they did. 

Ah.. here are the GPUG meetups:
