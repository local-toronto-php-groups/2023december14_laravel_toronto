Unfortunately, due to time pressures, Astrid Bailey and Katrina James are unable to do the preparation for their "Laravel Application From Scratch" presentation.

Lukasz Zagroba emailed me with a great question, and a tremendous inspiration. THANK YOU! Why not try out "Mob Programming"? Even though I have never tried it, nor Lukasz, and none of our Groups have tried it, why not go for it anyways? 

I know that the Guelph PHP User Group, run by Canada's only Laravel Partner, Vehikl, who helped get Laravel Toronto off the ground in the early days with SoapBox, uses Mob Programming, and does it from time to time at GPUG. I know this because Colin gave me a personal tour at Vehikl's offices in Waterloo and described what they did. 

Ah.. here are the GPUG meetups:
- [Laracon Special - Mob Programming with Vehikl](https://www.meetup.com/_gpug_/events/288382468/)
- [Laracon Special - Mob Programming with Vehikl](https://www.meetup.com/_gpug_/events/283489764/)

I thought that the way to go about doing this would be to, basically, plan the shit out of it. Divide the meet-up into 15 minute segments, assign roles, and dictate the basic app to be done. Except that this is pretty much contrary to the "soul" of Mob Programming.

Instead, I think that this thing needs to have a "life of its own". We'll see what happens!

I think that the one thing that makes this Mob Programming session different from what I've learned so far about it, is that we are doing it at our meet-up. The purpose, ultimately, is for people new to the Laravel Framework, to see how a Laravel Framework based web application is created and developed. The purpose, ultimately, is learning, not doing the app! A big attraction about trying out Mob Programming in our meet-up is that it is, by its very nature, highly interactive. 

This is a rare opportunity to ask your questions!

We need one computer for development. Is there someone who is ok for providing this computer? And to correspond through email with me about the set-up?

At the meet-up, better that I monitor the time segments, greet late-comers, be available for side-questions, and gently guide the overall process. Nuno did provide popcorn at YTZ International's first meet-up, so if there is popcorn on the 14th I will be enjoying it, watching this process play out. 

We need someone to "drive" the computer, and someone to "navigate" the driver. Meaning, the "driver" types, but is not supposed to take part in what they are typing. When the "driver" has an issue, they need to raise it. The "navigator" is quite a role. There is supposed to be, or can be, a third hard role, of someone representing the user side of the app being developed. However, I think the "navigator" should lead the discussion, perhaps in a chaotic kind of way. For once, at a meet-up, everyone talking at once might be acceptable! Again, Nuno, will there be popcorn?

I feel strongly that we have one "navigator". The role, for the purposes of our meet-up, is more a leader of the discussion. Who guides the discussions into decisions. Easier said than done, eh!

There are many ways to go about bootstrapping a Laravel Framework based app. You can create a project from the [https://github.com/laravel/laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) repo. You can [https://github.com/laravel/breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze). I think the group should decide.

My one caveat is to be reasonable about introducing complexity. The main thing is for devs that are new to the Laravel Framework get a sense of how to do a Laravel based web app from scratch. For example, the goal is not to demonstrate Livewire, so if using Livewire is complex, then let's not use it. I really do not know where the demarcation line is, but keep it in mind, and be open to the vocalizations about where the boundaries might be. 

I do not know what app to build. I think a "To Do" app is perhaps too simple. It is certainly too cliche. And perhaps will not hold attendees' attention enough. So this will be the first thing to "Mob" about.

I think the initial segment or two, we should plan who is doing the "driver" and "navigator". Then, let the group decide on who does these roles.
