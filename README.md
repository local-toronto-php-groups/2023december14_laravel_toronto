Unfortunately, due to time pressures, Astrid Bailey and Katrina James are unable to do the preparation for their "Laravel Application From Scratch" presentation.

Lukasz Zagroba emailed me with a great question, and a tremendous inspiration. THANK YOU! Why not try out "Mob Programming"? Even though I have never tried it, nor Lukasz, and none of our Groups have tried it, why not go for it anyways? 

I know that the Guelph PHP User Group, run by Canada's only Laravel Partner, Vehikl, who helped get Laravel Toronto off the ground in the early days with SoapBox, uses Mob Programming, and does it from time to time at GPUG. I know this because Colin gave me a personal tour at Vehikl's offices in Waterloo and described what they did. 

Ah.. here are the GPUG meetups:
- [Laracon Special - Mob Programming with Vehikl](https://www.meetup.com/_gpug_/events/288382468/)
- [Laracon Special - Mob Programming with Vehikl](https://www.meetup.com/_gpug_/events/283489764/)

I thought that the way to go about doing this would be to, basically, plan the shit out of it. Divide the meet-up into 15 minute segments, assign roles, and dictate the basic app to be done. Except that this is pretty much contrary to the "soul" of Mob Programming.

Instead, I think that this thing needs to have a "life of its own". We'll see what happens!

I think that the one thing that makes this Mob Programming session different from what I've learned so far about it, is that we are doing it at our meet-up. The purpose, ultimately, is for people new to the Laravel Framework, to see how a Laravel Framework based web application is created and developed. The purpose, ultimately, is learning, not doing the app! A big attraction about trying out Mob Programming in our meet-up is that it is, by its very nature, highly interactive. 

This is a rare opportunity to ask your questions!
